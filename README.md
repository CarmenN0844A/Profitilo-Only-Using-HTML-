# Sigas Paudel – Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — my very first website built entirely with **pure HTML**! This project is a reflection of my learning journey as a beginner web developer, showing the steps I’ve taken toward mastering full-stack development.

## About Me

I recently graduated high school with a Computer Science major and am passionate about coding. Though still learning, I focus on building projects hands-on, combining self-study with tutorials. This portfolio highlights my dedication, growth, and honest progress in web development.

## What’s Inside

### Projects
- **Form Validation Login Page:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Validates user input with simple logic.
- **C Calculator:** A basic calculator coded in C language, created from scratch to deepen my programming skills.
- **CRUD Operation:** A group project using PHP, HTML, and SQL to manage patient data in a database.

### Blog
A small collection of personal reflections, lessons learned, and funny moments on my coding journey — including how I lost a fashion website I worked hard on!

## Why This Portfolio?

It’s raw, honest, and simple — no frameworks, no fancy styling yet. Just pure HTML crafted with passion. It represents the start of my coding adventure and my commitment to continuous learning.

## Future Plans

- Add CSS for styling and layout  
- Make the site fully responsive for mobile devices  
- Use Git and GitHub for better version control and collaboration  
- Expand projects and blog content regularly
